## Auto Close Tag / Auto Rename Tag

Auto Close Tag and Auto Rename Tag are indispensable VS Code extensions for Svelte development that bring a delightful touch of convenience to your coding experience.

Svelte's similarity to HTML means that many HTML-focused extensions work seamlessly with Svelte files, and Auto Close Tag and Auto Rename Tag are shining examples of this compatibility.

**Auto Close Tag** automatically adds closing tags as you type, eliminating the need for manual completion. It saves you time and reduces the chances of errors in your code. No more worrying about forgetting to close tags or dealing with mismatched ones.

**Auto Rename** Tag simplifies tag renaming. When you change the name of an HTML tag, it automatically updates the corresponding closing tag. This saves you the trouble of manually modifying both tags, ensuring consistency and correctness throughout your codebase.

With Emmet in your toolkit, you can significantly enhance your productivity and efficiency during development. It is built right into VS Code, no extension required!
